# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This project helps a company to predict if it's any user is likely to churn or not

Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a crucial aspect for businesses to retain their customers. This project uses a dataset of customer features to train a logistic regression model to predict churn. The web application allows users to input specific features and get a churn prediction.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It includes features such as:

Senior Citizen
Tenure
Monthly Charges
Partner
Dependents
Online Security
Online Backup
Device Protection
Tech Support
Contract
Paperless Billing
Payment Method
Model Training
The model is trained using a logistic regression algorithm. The following steps were taken:

Data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Handling missing values and outliers.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the logistic regression model.
Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Web Application
The web application is built using Flask. It provides an interface for users to input the features and get a churn prediction. The application uses a pre-trained logistic regression model to make predictions.

Features
Input customer features through a user-friendly web form.
Predict whether a customer will churn or not.
Display the prediction result on the same page.

Open the web application.
Input the required customer features.
